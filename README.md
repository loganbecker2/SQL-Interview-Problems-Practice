# SQL Example Interview Questions
## Author: Logan Becker
### Since it has been a while since I used SQL, I am dedicating this repo to hold myself accountable to one SQL50 leetcode problem a day to keep SQL fresh in my head and not lose my SQL knowledge
### Update 10/29/2025 - I am also adding different folders for different websites I do data problems on! I am going to start doing some from DataLemur and soon some problems from data-puzzles.com

### UPDATES:  
10/8/2025 - Had an exam yesterday so forgot to do one yesterday.  
  
10/9/2025 - Today when solving an aggregate functions problem I refreshed my memory that not equal is "<>" and not "!=" which is the not equal in many coding languages. I also was forced to remember that string literals are identified by a single quote. I was trying double quotes to begin which gave me errors as double quotes are primarily used for identifiers such as a column name or table name. I am very glad I am doing this 50 day challenge because simple things like this seemed to have slowly withered from my memory about SQL.

10/19/2025 - Midterms kicked my butt all week and have been relaxing this weekend, I will get back on the horse this week, going to start a repo for datapuzzles.com too because I have been enjoying them a lot this weekend!

10/29/2025 - Adding organization for different websites problems, did a datalemur problem today that I really liked, using some sql functions and syntax I have almost forgotten about and how to use.
