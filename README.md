# SQL 50 leetcode study plan
## Author: Logan Becker
##### Since it has been a while since I used SQL, I am dedicating this repo to hold myself accountable to one SQL50 leetcode problem a day to keep SQL fresh in my head and not lose my SQL knowledge


UPDATES:  
10/8/2025 - Had an exam yesterday so forgot to do one yesterday.
10/9/2025 - Today when solving an aggregate functions problem I refreshed my memory that not equal is "<>" and not "!=" which is the not equal in many coding languages. I also was forced to remember that string literals are identified by a single quote. I was trying double quotes to begin which gave me errors as double quotes are primarily used for identifiers such as a column name or table name. I am very glad I am doing this 50 day challenge because simple things like this seemed to have slowly withered from my memory about SQL.
